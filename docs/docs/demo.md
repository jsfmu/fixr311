# Demo Script (2–3 minutes)

Goal: show an end-to-end experience even without direct city submission.

---

## Setup (before recording)
- Seed 10–30 sample reports so the map looks alive.
- Prepare 2–3 photos (pothole, illegal dumping, broken streetlight).
- Ensure deploy is stable and AI has a fallback template.
- Open 2 browser tabs:
  1) Fixr app
  2) A blank doc or “Example submission form” page (optional)

## Script

### 0:00–0:15 — Problem
“Reporting community issues is high-friction. People don’t know what to write, where to report, or they don’t want accounts. Fixr makes reporting a 60-second action by generating a clean, ready-to-submit report draft.”

### 0:15–1:05 — Create report (pothole)
1. Click **Create Report**
2. Upload pothole photo (optional)
3. Drop a pin / confirm location
4. Select issue type + severity
5. Click **Generate Draft**
6. Highlight the structured report text
7. Click **Save**
8. Open **Share Link** in a new tab

**Callout line**
“Instead of filling out forms, you instantly get a city-ready draft you can copy, email, or submit anywhere.”

### 1:05–1:30 — Handoff (without “sending”)
1. Click **Copy Report**
2. Paste into:
   - a blank doc, OR
   - a small “Example submission form” section on your site
3. (Optional) click **Email Draft** (mailto)
4. (Optional) click **Open City Portal** (just a link)

**Honesty line**
“This MVP drafts and packages reports; direct portal submission is a post-hackathon integration.”

### 1:30–2:10 — Second report (illegal dumping, fast)
Repeat quickly:
- upload photo → generate → save

### 2:10–2:40 — Map + incentive
1. Open **Map**
2. Show the new pin appears
3. Click a pin to preview the report
4. Mention visibility incentive:
   - “The map + share links create instant payoff and community visibility, which increases reporting.”

### 2:40–3:00 — Close + next steps
“Fixr reduces friction, improves report quality, and makes issues visible. Next steps: direct portal routing/submission, dedupe, and status tracking.”

## Optional “wow” moment (if implemented)
